# This file uses what's called the YAML format.
# Comments begin with the number sign, like these lines do.

# Additionally, indentation is important.
# Try to match the number of spaces at the beginning of each line.

# At 0 spaces, you'll be specifying the name of your own character.
# At 2 spaces, you'll be specifying the target of the greeting, usually the
#              name of someone else's character.
# At 4 spaces, you'll be listing all the greetings to randomly choose from for
#              that target.

# Here's an example:

Your.Name:
  __default:
    # Default greetings go here.
    # If the target has no custom greets, a line will be picked from this list.
    # You can have as few or as many lines as you want for any target.
    - "Aloha!"
    - "How's it going?"

  __miss:
    # If your greet does not land on anybody, a line will be chosen from here.
    # This list is optional, and if omitted, a greeting will be chosen from
    # your __default list.
    - "Hello World!"
    - "Have we met before?"

  Friend.Name:
    # You're not limited to 40 characters per greeting, but exercise common
    # sense and try not to go overboard.
    - "You need my help?"
    - "This isn't my first rodeo, you know."

# If you have multiple characters, you can just start a new section for them.
# If your character does not have an entry in here, then the module will not
# do anything and your greetings assigned in game will be used.

Other.Alt:
  __default:
    # If you want to use a quotation mark ( " ) anywhere in your greeting,
    # you'll need to put a backslash ( \ ) in front of it.
    - "Your face is \"strange\". Is it always like that?"

    # If you want to put a backslash in your greeting, you'll need to put
    # another one in front of it.
    - "\\o/"
